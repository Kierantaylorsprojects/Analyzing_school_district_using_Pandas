# Analyzing_school_district_using_Pandas

## Summary

In this project, I utilized the pandas library to process and analyze two CSV files consisting of school and student data.

More specifically, I calculated the passing rates for different students in both reading and math for the whole data set.

I then aggregated the data to show the same passing rates based on the school budget, per student budget, grade, school size, and school type. 

## Findings: 

1. In most of the filtering, students tended to have lower passing rates in math than in reading. 

2. The smaller schools tended to have higher passing rates than the larger schools.

3. The charter schools tended to have higher passing rates than the disctrict schools.
