# Analyzing_school_district_using_Pandas

Summary

In this project I utilized the pandas library to process and analyze two csv files consisting of school and student data. 

More specifcially, I calculated the passing rates for different stundets in both reading and math for the whole data set. 

I then aggregated the data to show the same passing rates based on school budget, per student budget, grade, school size and school type.
